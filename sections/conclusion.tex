\section{Concluding Remarks \& Lessons Learned}
\label{conclusion}

In the end we notice that there are many ways to both prevent and detect administrator attacks. The preventative techniques are simple and are taken from classical computing security models. The detection techniques are much more complicated and often involve lots of system monitoring, or setting up an entire fake network to catch malicious insiders. It is also clear that the key to a safe and solid infrastructure is combined use of all the latter mentioned techniques. There is still a lot of research to be done on catching and preventing the insider but by pairing these techniques together one is able to create a fairly safe and secure environment as a user or service provider.
